<h3 id="one-to-two-paragraphs-summarize-the-work-that-you-have-completed-so-far-">One to two paragraphs, summarize the work that you have completed so far.</h3>
<p>We succesfully implemented sequential CBS in C++ and were able to validate that our solutions were correct and optimal by comparing it to several benchmarks. We have also begun to setup the evaluation suite that we will use for comparing our results by generating random locations for agents within a specific environment. We are also at various stages of completion for the paralleization of the algorithm. We have chosen two separate approaches to determine if one is better than the other.</p>
<p>The two approaches to parallelization were to either parallelize the high level search which we attempted briefly and had mixed results. Part of the work moving forward will be to put a little more effort on this front to reduce contention and split tasks more efficiently. The other approache was to parallelize the low level A<em> search using a technique called HDA</em>. <Explain a little more and briefly mention results></p>
<h3 id="describe-how-you-are-doing-with-respect-to-the-goals-and-deliverables-stated-in-your-proposal-do-you-still-believe-you-will-be-able-to-produce-all-your-deliverables-if-not-why-what-about-the-nice-to-haves-in-your-milestone-writeup-we-want-a-new-list-of-goals-that-you-plan-to-hit-for-the-poster-session-">Describe how you are doing with respect to the goals and deliverables stated in your proposal. Do you still believe you will be able to produce all your deliverables? If not, why? What about the ”nice to haves”? In your milestone writeup we want a new list of goals that you plan to hit for the poster session.</h3>
<p>Our goals for the poster session will not change from the intial goals we set out. Below is a list of our planned goals and those that have been compleeted thus far.</p>
<p>Planned Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Develop single-threaded CBS algorithm in C++<ul>
<li>[x] Implement low level path finding search</li>
<li>[x] Implement high level conflict search</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Develop parallelized CBS algorithm in C++<ul>
<li>[x] Achieve correctness while running on the GHC machines</li>
<li>[ ] Complete search in shorter time than single-threaded version</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Set up environment to evaluate algorithms for correctness and performance<ul>
<li>[ ] Characterize number of agents single-threaded CBS can accomodate</li>
<li>[ ] Characterize number of agents multi-threaded CBS can accomodate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As is shown above we have completed a majority of the planned goals. The remaining goals for evaluation are relatively simple and will take a very short amount of time to complete. We are still currently in the process of tweaking our parallel CBS algorithm as we have been able to show a speedup but not to the degree we would like. As for the stretch goals, due to time constraints (mainly from the myriad of other projects from other classes) we will not be attempting them.</p>

<p>We will show the results of our analysis i.e. graphs/tables of performance speedup as well as a couple videos of the algorithms output. We may also briefly discuss major bottlenecks we found and other interesting findings.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-preliminary-results-at-this-time-if-so-it-would-be-great-to-included-them-in-your-milestone-write-up-">Do you have preliminary results at this time? If so, it would be great to included them in your milestone write-up.</h3>

<p>Our current issues/concerns is how to efficiently perform the task breakdown in the high level CBS. Since a large part of the algorithm relies on the priority queue it is an interesting challenge to split the work amongst processors without violating guarantess on correctness that the algorithm provides. However, we are confident with a little more time we will be able to find an appropriate solution.</p>
